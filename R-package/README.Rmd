# cdifdif

The goal of cdifdif is to ...

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r}
library(cdifdif)

data("spilloverDGP")

str(spilloverDGP)

mod <- cdifdif(y1 ~ time + treat, data = spilloverDGP, dist = spilloverDGP$dist,
               maxDist = 30, delta = 1, alpha = 0.05, k = 10, verbose = FALSE)
```

We can obtain all the CV-RMSE and plot them.

```{r}
plot(mod$cvs, type = "l", main = "CV RMSEs")
```

And get the model where we obtain that error:

```{r}
nmod <- which.min(mod$cvs)
nmod

mod$cvs[[nmod]]
```

And then the model:

```{r}
mod$mods[[nmod]]$summaries[[nmod]]
```
