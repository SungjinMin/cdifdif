Title: Spillover Robust Difference-in-Differences Estimation
Description: This package implements spillover robust difference-in-differences estimates as described in Clarke (2017).  It tests for local spillovers in a  diff-in-diff setting, and optimally determines spillover propagation. It returns estimates of both the treatment effect, as well as (if relevant) the treatment effect on those close to treated, who weren't themselves treated.
